            <p>Hey friends! I'm Ranya.</p>
            <p>By day, I'm the story-crafter for Nablus University- NUVTE, covering everything from student life to high-stakes meetings with the university president.</p>
            <p>Between juggling translations and shaping the university's public image, you'll find me watching silly cats videos, doing sports, or getting lost in the pages of a good book. Loud laugh included!</p>
            <p> In the midst of it all, my motto is simple: "Trust your struggle".</p>

            <h2>Nablus City</h2>
            <p>Located in a strategic position between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, Nablus is considered the largest commercial and cultural center in Palestine.</p>
            <p>In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala.</p>
            <p>Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. </p>
